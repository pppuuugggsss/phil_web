		Since 2021, the Philippines has been a recurring topic in our conversations with Marts.<br>What started as casual talks gradually turned into a shared dream to one day explore the islands together and experience the vibrant beauty of the country firsthand. <br><br>

Then, on a random night in January 2023, after years of daydreaming and imagining what it would be like, we finally made the decision that changed everything: we bought the plane tickets.<br>A one-month journey to my beautiful homeland was no longer just a fantasy... it was happening. <br><br>

With excitement came responsibility.<br>We now had to plan the entire trip.<br>There were countless islands we wanted to explore, each with its own unique charm.<br>But with only a month, we knew we had to make tough choices.<br>Time wasn't on our side, and neither was the weather.<br><br>

The Philippines' rainy season stretches from June to November, and our trip would fall right in the middle of it.<br>That meant the possibility of unpredictable storms and, worse, typhoons... a real concern for any traveler, but especially for us on our first big adventure together.<br><br>
So we took our time.<br>We researched carefully, weighed every option, and made deliberate choices.<br>Every destination, every route, and every plan was made with caution and care, all in the hopes of making the most of this once-in-a-lifetime experience.
